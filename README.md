TASK 01: Responsive Landing Page

Excited to Share My Latest Project at Prodigy InfoTech

I've recently completed a task to design and implement a Responsive Landing Page (Amazon) with an interactive navigation menu. This project involved:

• Created an interactive navigation menu that changes style when scrolled or when hovered over a menu item.

• A fixed-position navigation menu visible on all pages.

• Utilizing HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic behaviour.
